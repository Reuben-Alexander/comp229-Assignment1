The goal was to create a realtor website and I decided to make my pet cat into one! This project had multiple html files. There was first the homepage, which is visible in the picture, an active listings page with a list of houses on sale, a contact page, and a sitemap which gave direct links to the other html files.</p>

                    <p id="secondProDes"><h3>Project 2</h3>The second project was my third assignment for my javascript course. The goal was to create a game where you click on an image of a bug to earn ponts. To make it a challenge, each successful click resulted in inccreasing the speed at which the bug "moves around". It was tricky implementing code that would make the game playable in all devices, but after lots of testing I was able to make it work well.</p>

                    <p id="thirdProDes"><h3>Project 3</h3>The third project would actually be this portfolio site! In this site i've been using knowledge learned from both projects and adding new things i've learned, such as react. New features applied to this project is that this will be avaliable in 2 new forms! The first is the code will be pushed into my GitHub account and the second would be this site will be hosted on a cloud server!</p>
